SCRIPT: Deduplicate ZAP projects from HPD RFPs
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************/

/************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
METHODOLOGY: 
1. Merge ZAP projects to HPD RFPs using spatial and proximity matching.
2. If an HPD RFP maps to multiple ZAP projects, create a preference methodology to make 1-1 matches
3. Eliminate inaccurate proximity-based matches.
